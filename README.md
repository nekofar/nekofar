### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Milad, and I am a self-taught software developer who is passionate about crypto and web3 technologies. With a background in the software industry, I am currently focused on consulting, contracting, and freelancing in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies and web3.

Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked with various platforms, honing my skills in mobile and web development. However, my true passion lies in exploring the innovative and decentralized realm of crypto and web3 applications. I love crafting smart contracts, creating decentralized applications (DApps), and diving deep into the world of blockchain.

My main goal is to empower startups and businesses in the crypto space by providing valuable insights and technical expertise. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or need some blockchain magic infused into your work, let's connect and explore the infinite possibilities of collaboration. Together, we can shape the future of decentralized technology!
